declare the map to contain <string, Format*> instead of <string, Format> as it does currently.

write "&" in front of each use of the Format constructor.

change every use of	kindaPointer->second.whatever to
			kindaPointer->second->whatever

put the map in a class.

make fillMap a function in that class.

instantiate the class and call fillMap on it.
